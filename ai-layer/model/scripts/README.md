# Model Analysis & Comparison Scripts

This folder contains utility scripts for model comparison, analysis, and reporting.

## Scripts

### Model Comparison
- **compare_dnn_vs_pycaret.py** - Compares DNN and PyCaret model architectures
- **compare_10k_vs_50k.py** - Analyzes scaling impact from 10K to 50K dataset
- **compare_10k_v2_v3.py** - Compares v2 (basic) vs v3 (with BMI/DRG/ICU) features
- **compare_all_models.py** - Comprehensive comparison across all model configurations
- **compare_results.py** - Compares specific model results

### Analysis & Reporting
- **analyze_scaling_potential.py** - Theoretical analysis of dataset scaling benefits
- **generate_final_report.py** - Generates comprehensive comparison report for all models

## Key Comparisons Made

### Architecture Comparison (DNN vs PyCaret)
- **Script:** `compare_dnn_vs_pycaret.py`
- **Result:** Both excellent, DNN has slight edge on OUD recall (98.44% vs 82.81%)

### Dataset Size Impact (10K vs 50K)
- **Script:** `compare_10k_vs_50k.py`
- **Result:** Marginal improvement (+0.49% Eligibility, -0.34% OUD)
- **Conclusion:** 10K dataset sufficient for production

### Feature Engineering Impact (v2 vs v3)
- **Script:** `compare_10k_v2_v3.py`
- **Result:** v3 features (BMI, DRG, ICU) significantly improved Eligibility model (64% → 81% AUC)

## Usage

These scripts are used for:
1. **Model Selection** - Determining best model configuration for production
2. **Performance Analysis** - Understanding model strengths and weaknesses
3. **Scaling Decisions** - Evaluating cost-benefit of larger datasets
4. **Documentation** - Generating reports for stakeholders

## Reporting

The main comprehensive report is generated by:
```bash
python generate_final_report.py
```

This creates a formatted comparison of all model configurations with production recommendations.

## Note

These are analysis scripts for model evaluation and are not part of the training or inference pipeline. The main training scripts are:
- `../dnn_models.py` - Train DNN models (production)
- `../pycaret_models.py` - Train PyCaret models (alternative)
